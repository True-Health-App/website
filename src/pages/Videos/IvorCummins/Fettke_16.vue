      Ivor: 00:00 We're here at low carb universe and me Orca. And as you can
      see, the beautiful backdrop behind us, but we're still working
      hard. Don't worry about that. And I meeting with this morning
      with a doctor, Gardy Fatca. I'm Belinda Fatca who have a very
      interesting story to tell. So delays to Meta game. Gary, I'll have a
      Linda, thank you for having us. Oh my pleasure. Absolutely. And
      you have a fascinating story. We'll kind of two stories. First your
      persecution on exoneration and then you get home to the
      fascinating kind of background of where all the dietary
      guidelines guidelines came from and why ultimately you got
      into trouble. So maybe, yeah, maybe Gary if you start with that.
      Well,
      Dr. Gary Fettke: 00:40 a lot of people already know. My story is very similar to Tim
      Noakes. Uh, going back several years I started challenging
      hospital food and particularly the amount of sugar that was
      given to my patients. And I, I look, I'm an orthopedic surgeon in
      Tasmania for many years I've been looking after the
      complications of diabetes and particularly foot ulceration. So
      I've been shopping toes off, chopping legs off for for a couple of
      decades. And ultimately you get sick and tired of it. So I looked
      at prevention and quite clearly sugar became the number one
      problem. So I started questioning the amount of sugar my
      patients who are getting in hospital. And to this day, if you've
      got diabetes and hospital, it's still recommended that you get to
      three desserts per day. So I said, look, this is crazy. This is
      ridiculous. And I started questioning that in the process of
      questioning the sugar in the hospital, in the hospital, food and
      junk food in the hospital.
      Dr. Gary Fettke: 01:33 I started questioning the quality of hospital food and we all
      know hospital food is lousy and can be improved. So that
      incurred the wrath of the Dietitians in the hospital and uh, over
      a period of time, ultimately I ended up getting reported to the
      medical board for being dangerous for recommending anti
      sugar and low carb, um, and the medical. And then I
      subsequently got reported again by another Dietitian for
      inappropriately climbing to reverse reverse someone's diabetes,
      which I'm guilty of it. Okay. We did reverse his diabetes and
      only came off five medications, lost 20 kilos and all of that. So,
      and then there was a third notification to the medical board,
      which ultimately got dismissed. But the first two were taken
      very seriously and over a couple of years, two and a half years, I
      was investigated. And a decision was made against me to say
      that I'm not allowed to advise my patients as an orthopedic
      surgeon to reduce their sugar intake even, even if it was shown
      to be best practice.
      Dr. Gary Fettke: 02:35 And that was a decision that was made lifelong and non
      appealable. Uh, so obviously, um, you know, once you see the
      results of low carb for your patients, you can unseat them. So
      I've never stopped talking about it. And if, and, and with the
      support of Belinda with her research and with the support of
      social media and the community, we've kept on challenging that
      and it's involved to Senate inquiries at a national level. It's
      involved the national ombudsman and after two more years of
      appealing, it might not appealable decision. It's crazy. We can
      go to the supreme court, like they couldn't use the judicial
      system to appeal it, but we could go to the national health
      ombudsman to see if there's a problem with the process. That
      was all she could rule on and she couldn't, she couldn't say. So
      we showed that there were problems in the process, which
      clearly there were, and Belinda will allude to those and
      ultimately was sent to an independent medical board. And I
      looked at it for six weeks and I tossed it all out and said, this is
      ridiculous. Not alleged side that I wasn't guilty of anything.
      They've actually apologized. Now that's uh, that's, uh, almost
      unheard of that they actually get an apology from the medical
      board. But ultimately we lost five years of being dragged
      through the system. And in that timeframe, my lecturing, the
      students was taken away. My research was curtailed and we've
      been stuck in that limbo. But in the same timeframe, we've also
      been, you know, going forward to the public.
      Ivor: 04:13 Yeah, well, it's an incredible job to have gone through all that.
      Both of you actually, obviously it's your shared, the experience,
      so to speak. It was all particularly malicious because I noted at
      the time, which was incredible. They said that even if the
      science advanced and you were proven to be correct, you
      would still remain banned for life from speaking. That's a
      bizarre,
      Dr. Gary Fettke: 04:35 it was completely bizarre. I don't know, obviously I questioned
      that and that's one of the things which the national ombudsman
      was actually to hang on cause she said even she said, hang on
      this, this is a, how can you make, how can you, because so many
      things I say that science evolves by being challenged, not by
      being followed. And you know, that's not the bottom of my
      emails. I mean that's my, my mantra. So we have to keep
      evolving and our knowledge and there are things we do today
      which are going to be shown to be wrong in the, in the future as
      I had been the past. And so, uh, it was, it was a dumb ruling and
      you know, and thank goodness, common sense, spiteful and it
      was their undoing. Really.
      Ivor: 05:22 Yeah. It's like, it was amazing to me and I, and I've seen a lot of
      corruption in this whole sphere, obviously like yourselves, but,
      but that one struck me as bizarre. The thought crossed my mind
      as well. That's kind of implicating them, uh, in the sense. So it
      did turn out to be and how we got here then as the older
      parents of the story. So you're exonerated and it's a huge shot
      in the arm for people all over the world trying to promote
      healthier food like noax exoneration, yours and adult
      [inaudible].
      Dr. Gary Fettke: 05:53 It's literally mine was the last case to be closed. And so
      therefore I know that it's pretty well open. The flood gates, I
      mean I've been contacted by hundreds of doctors who have
      said, actually, we feel safe now to go, go ahead with this and
      talk about it. And so therefore it has opened the door and it
      now can become best practice in diabetes management with
      can become,
      Belinda Fettke: 06:16 he says it can become, but you look on our dietary guidelines
      and you look at the Dietitians Association of Australia, which is
      our peak nutrition body. Yeah. And they still calling low carb a
      fad. So while the medical board has said yes, I think you can go
      forward with this, I can't see a problem. The guidelines still a
      rule books that are not going to allow it to move forward. So,
      Dr. Gary Fettke: 06:38 and that is a great segue into how did we get here with these
      absurd guidelines. They quite frankly conflict with the science at
      this point. There's no question. Well let's, let's take a snapshot
      of time now, which is if we look at, we've got an obesity
      epidemic, we've got an a health crisis on the planet right now.
      You can see that walking down the street and so we've hadn't
      placed dietary guidelines for a long period of time. And one of
      the arguments is that we don't follow the dietary guidelines.
      Well we know we do. If you look at the last 40 50 years of data
      out of the u s out of Australia, out of the UK, we have in fact
      increased their cereal in grains. We've decreased our meat and
      particularly a red meat consumption. We've done that. So the
      current dietary guidelines are serial based, grain based, anti
      meat and dairy and rapidly becoming Vegan.
      Dr. Gary Fettke: 07:33 So let's, that's the food pyramid. That's really what's being
      promoted and, and guess what? It hasn't worked. So therefore
      we've looked to say, look, and obviously low carb healthy fat
      living is not the food pyramid. So if we accept the fact that the
      dietary guidelines now have been a complete and utter failure
      and have since the McGovern report and the introduction of the
      Diet, the American dietary goals, then we've gone back to see
      how come we've gotten to this situation because Belinda said,
      we're talking, you know, we're all going blue in the face talking
      about this and blend has gone. Well, hang on guys. Why? Why
      are we being obstructed? Why have I been obstructed? It's got
      to be in those dietary guidelines. But more importantly, what's
      influencing them? Turns out that that's, that's the segue in
      whatever we're doing at the moment isn't working. I'm
      challenging that. What am I challenging the guidelines or am I
      challenging the vested interests? And as it turned out, it's the
      vested interest that had been blocking myself and others in this
      whole process.
      Belinda Fettke: 08:36 And I think that, I guessed that it could well be the sugar
      industry in Australia. We have a very large sugar and wheat
      industry. So we sort of thought, okay, they're really unhappy
      about that. So I thought it was a vested interests and, but when
      I started looking deeper, it was really fascinating. Everyone sort
      of gotten stuck in his 1977 the change to the low fat guidelines.
      But I just kept going back and it was fascinating all the way back
      to, um, what I've, what I've come to understand is it's the
      evolution of the, so the evolution of our plant based dietary
      guidelines have come from the two arms of the temperance
      movement, which sounds really bizarre going all the back to the
      18 hundreds and in prefacing this conversation, I think it's really
      important to say that I'm not anti religion in any way.
      Belinda Fettke: 09:25 Um, going down and finding some very strong religious
      influences on our dietary guidelines was just something I never
      expected to find. Um, so I'm not anti religion and I'm not anti
      vegetarian or Vegan. Even. I think people have the right to a
      choice in whether that's cultural, ethical, or religious ideology.
      They have that ability to have that choice in our current society,
      I would think, and certainly from me, but as I've gone through
      and looked at their influence, the influence of vested interest
      and religious ideology on our dietary guidelines, and particularly
      the evolution of the plant based, which is I believe a Vegan, um,
      doctor guidelines, they've taken away my choice and they've
      taken away your choice and they've taken away society's choice
      to eat meat. And it's bizarre. You think? I thought Gary was in
      trouble for talking about sugar and cereal, but it was actually,
      he was in trouble for advocating animal protein and animal fats.
      Ivor: 10:26 Right. And this story, and I'm broadly familiar with the build, the
      viewers may not be, it goes back literally to the 18 hundreds if
      you do proper detective work, which no one really house, it's
      evil Linda, except Belinda. Can I just say though,
      Belinda Fettke: 10:41 I'm a racist southern. Um, there's a young guy in, in America,
      um, race southern has done a lot of research into specifically
      the seventh day Adventist church dieticians on the dietary
      guidelines and stuff from about the 1950s a lot of my research I
      got from him, so I'm not the only person, but he hadn't realized
      the medical influences. He was specifically Dietitians, but he
      gave me an amazing segue into, into going back, but I then went
      back even further because I found that the introduction of the,
      well, the formation of the American Dietetic Association was
      founded by a seventh day Adventist. So you're going even
      further back, but he'd certainly found a lot of information from
      the 1950s
      Ivor: 11:28 all right, great. So if we go to the, the origins of the origin, the
      hundreds, yeah,
      Belinda Fettke: 11:35 yeah.
      Ivor: 11:35 Where it really began, this influencing force that, that I guess
      grew over the century and became more and more organized
      and more and more modern and subtle in its actions. It started
      in the late 18 hundreds with the certain lady. I think
      Belinda Fettke: 11:51 it actually started right the beginning of the 18 hundreds with a
      guy called Silvester Graham. And you may have heard of
      Graham crackers and Graham flour and all those, they will all to
      stop people being stimulated by caffeine and alcohol and
      cigarettes and meat. And they believed there was a scientific
      and political and religious, um, rationale for vegetarianism. So
      he was the health reformers of the early 18 hundreds where the
      start of this rationale, western vegetarianism, vegetarianism is
      completely different to eastern vest vegetarianism. That's Gary
      will explain that.
      Dr. Gary Fettke: 12:25 Well used to be determined is based upon a cultural respect for
      where the animal sits within the whole food cycle. And it even
      at eastern vegetarianism they will eat some animal produce and
      then when the animal gets old aisle, you know, for a lot of
      religions they will actually eat the animal, but it's done in a
      respectful way. And so eastern vegetarian is built on centuries
      of care for the soil environment like it and the whole picture.
      Whereas Western vegetarianism really only goes back to the
      early 18 hundreds and it's purely nice people. Yeah. To, to, to
      quill last bit they're lost and it seems strange, but that's what it
      is. And then that's evolved into one group, which was the
      founding founders of the Baptist Church. Um, and then
      struggling,
      Belinda Fettke: 13:16 they brought those principles of, so it wasn't just stimulants of
      again, um, caffeine and alcohol and cigarettes, but they believe
      one of the biggest stimulants in our life was meat and it actually
      became t church doctrine to not eat meat to Stuart bays or
      passions. And the most heinous sin of all was masturbation. So
      this is where serials came from. The cereal industry was burst
      from this belief that we that to try and find ways for people to
      have, um, uh, protein and different things in their body to, to
      get rid of meat.
      Ivor: 13:56 Right. Because miss was seen and I think the, the, the origins of
      the words, I mean, Karna meet carnal. There's a lot of negative
      connotations in history and I guess they really jumped on that
      and saw it has a really big negative influence on is the society
      like alcohol or our tanks
      Belinda Fettke: 14:17 mate was masturbation. That her very first, her entire book, her
      first book was all, it was a solemn appeal to mothers and how to
      stop your child masturbating on. The biggest thing was not to
      put meat on their table and I segwayed. It's sort of differently in
      my talks. I really came back and, and talk about the timber to
      movement and, and worked out ways because John Harvey
      Kellogg is obviously someone we recognizes, a person involved
      with the cereal industry and he and his brother developed the
      flight to cereal, but it was so then I said, well yeah, why? Why
      was he so intent on developing peanut butters and that made
      analogs and all of these other things. He was at temperance
      health reformer and he was a devout seventh day Adventist. So
      you bring those things down and you think will the, we've got
      Kellogg's corn flakes from an anti masturbation crusade. Good.
      Poor old John Harvey Kellogg. Yeah. He's a brilliant individually
      in see greatness in the medical pathway, medical education
      reform. That's she patients on food and exercise equipment.
      But there's a 12 year old,
      Dr. Gary Fettke: 15:24 he was invited into the white family and he was type setting
      these doctrines. He was type setting, as a twelve year old, the
      real cause of masturbation...
      Belinda Fettke: 15:35 And that the effect of masturbation was as bad as inwardly
      decaying ahead and also like her, her book was horrific. If you
      read all the things that masturbation could do to you. And he
      was 12 years old when he was type setting these books, and
      type set for the next, you know, he type set for years for them
      and wrote or he was actually editing and doing things. So
      there's no wonder by the time he grew up to become a doctor,
      he had very strong ideas on how bad masturbation was.
      Dr. Gary Fettke: 16:06 Following on from that, we, we should state that the weird
      things are now, is it the latest church is the second biggest
      educator in the world after the Catholic Church and they are
      primary schools, secondary schools, universities, but they pretty
      well started the dietetics education of the world. They wrote
      the textbooks for the first 30 years, heavily involved in the
      textbooks, nursing and medicine. They still own 60 publishing
      houses and they're pretty well.... And as I said to you recently
      that I've had 6.4 billion downloads of their podcasts in 2016...
      Ivor: 16:42 now I'm, I was struck by that figure because I mean, it puts Joe
      Rogan to shame, but 6.4 billion downloads just gives an idea of
      the influence that's occurring. And I think the financials of this -
      this whole organization that are influencing in so many ways,
      their financials are quite stunning too - across the world aren't
      they...
      Dr. Gary Fettke: 17:06 They own pretty well - they are so involved in the food industry
      horizontally and vertically. Uh, acknowledging the, only about
      eight weeks ago, the senior members of the Adventist Church
      published an article in journal called religion acknowledging
      virtually everything we're talking about now. So this is not,
      they're not hiding it then actually not upset by it. They're
      actually proud of what they've been able to achieve. And so
      they are, they are the originators of nutrition science. They have
      been heavily involved in our nutritional guidelines since the
      beginning because the American Dietetics Association was
      formed in October, 1917 by Linda Cooper who wrote these
      textbooks. She worked with John Hart for John Harvey Kellogg.
      She was an Adventist and a vegetarian and a vegetarian at that
      time actually turns out you were Vegan. The term Vegan didn't
      turn up until...
      Belinda Fettke: 18:00 Vegan wasn't coined until 1944. The Adventist church doctrine
      was based on the garden of Eden. They were young Earth
      creationists. And so the garden of Eden was um, fruits, nuts,
      vegetables and saves and so that was all. So there's no history in
      hunter gatherer. There's no place in their history of, there's no
      evolution, there's no place in history for meat. So they truly
      believe this is what we should be eating. And
      Dr. Gary Fettke: 18:29 so the eating of meat is almost an aberration. It's humans going
      a bit crazy. Yes. And driving further craziness and self abuse. It's
      ....I didn't know any of the story obviously before you dug it all
      up and the other guy, whoever. But I was aware that in the
      McGovern commission there was a very influential young
      person who was a vegetarian. I was aware of that fact and I
      suspected that - because vegetarian or particularly Vegan
      people are extremely motivated ideologically, whereas the
      average person is not, I was always guessing they were
      disproportionately represented in guidelines, bodies and
      anywhere where they could influence, which is okay, I would do
      that if I was ideologically motivated. But I think it's just so much
      more huge than we thought
      Dr. Gary Fettke: 19:16 They've been working their way up through the system for a
      hundred years.
      Belinda Fettke: 19:21 And can I say when they, a lot of their ideas are amazing. Like it
      really is. It's about rest and exercise and a whole lot ... sunlight
      and community and the anti-alcohol, cigarettes and stimulants.
      But what's really fascinating is how they've moved together. So
      as I say that, the two forms of the temperance movement, one
      was the health reformer ones which is the anti-meat group, but
      they've joined with the other temperance movement, which is
      anti-alcohol and has spawned the sugar industry. So not, it
      doesn't start the sugar, but it formed these industries of Coca
      Cola and this ice cream Sundaes and chocolate and all those
      other things. So this sweet...and also then putting the sweet
      into the cereals, it allowed them to find a way to celebrate as
      family's and big communities and whatever else - and not
      having alcohol. So the Soda Fountains were called the new
      American bar. It was an ally of temperance. So the food industry
      that was creating the sugar and the, and the food industry from
      the Seventh Day Adventists that we're all aligned with the
      vegetarian substitutes of meat - just match so beautifully
      together - because the sugar gave shelf life to the vegetarian
      products. It doesn't help meat. So yeah, this is where it's all
      interconnected. And Harvard University was the start of, um,
      the nutrition foundation and the school of public health were all
      started by food industry. So five food industries gave money to
      this nutrition foundation, which was part of the Harvard School
      of Public Health. And they worked with the Adventist church to
      do the very first Adventist studies - because it suits both. They
      grow together and even though they've got very opposing ideas
      about things, the interconnection has just helped,
      Dr. Gary Fettke: 21:18 ...and this has happened in all of human history. To be honest,
      it, it seems bizarre what you described, but to be, to me it's
      actually makes it makes complete sense because in human
      history we've always had different sects and organizations who
      have common goals, you know who get together even though
      they might differ significantly on one or two things. So it kind of
      all just came together throughout the 20th century that they
      grew and grew and power and influence until labor kind of
      embedded in all of the structures that the financially, to come
      back to that the, the, the cereal industry 101 cereal companies
      were formed in Battle Creek, Michigan, which is the home of
      the Adventist church and over time we've effectively got
      Kellogg's and all of their affiliates, but because they largely
      owned by originally by the advantages and I have advanced
      work for them, their tires, you can imagine 10% of the profits of
      the cereal industry is going back into the church in Australia.
      LNG white came to Australia and started a company called
      Sanitarium, which is Australia's most trusted company.
      Belinda Fettke: 22:30 She set up the entire church, but she also wanted to set up the
      steel industry as church owned. So that was different. Kellogg's
      was a seventh day Adventist and he started his own business,
      but they actually came to Australia and set the feet into Skype
      as a church.
      Dr. Gary Fettke: 22:43 Yeah. And that Church owns the biggest cereal company in
      Australia and they don't pay any tax, but they put it all back into
      educating the community. So that's where the enormous
      resources come from to create the billions of podcasts and
      everything else. Because the profits are not being taken by
      corporate executive types and shareholders to the church. But
      they have this purpose, they believe clearly in what they're
      doing. It's all plowed straight back into medical evangelism with
      charity status. So it no tax,
      Belinda Fettke: 23:21 there's no tax on Sanitarium and they make 462 different
      products and they don't pay any tax. But
      Ivor: 23:26 Sanitarium being the biggest cereal company in Australia. I
      mean that, I guess I'm just coming back - they are very large
      amounts of revenue, indeed - wow.
      Dr. Gary Fettke: 23:38 But then they brought (the Adventist church) by Harry Miller,
      brought uh, soil from Ida, fermented soy to the concept of soil
      to the Western world. So that modern soy product, which is
      that as an alternative to substitute. So we've got fake meat,
      fake dairy, we've got infant formulas which are made
      predominantly from Soy and developed the first infant soy
      formula. So if you think about the massive impact of soy in the
      food cycle and going all the way back to affecting our
      agricultural practice, now we're plowing of soil to put in more
      soybean that is actually all from the one group. So that whole
      soy industry is paying ties back into the one church group. And
      that's where the funding is. And all of this stuff is actually in
      their annual reports. I mean, it's not, it's not hidden - significant
      portions of it. And so you can actually read their annual reports.
      They've got all the figures. And it talks about the industries they
      actually own....
      Ivor: 24:47 And I think that is a very important point because along with the
      disclaimer, and I'll also echo that one, that vegetarian is fineI've many vegetarian friends. In fact, in our Irish medical group
      we're setting up, um, we have a vegan psychiatrist, a doctor in
      our group. So it's fine with not to try and influence the whole
      world and the way we're discussing.
      Belinda Fettke: 25:11 Yes. But the other is taking away choice. That's, that's the thing.
      They're taking away a choice by developing these rule books
      that silence my husband
      Ivor: 25:22 exactly. The under obviously have I used the word corrupted,
      but it is corrupted soy refined grains and infant formulas and all
      the fake food that's having an enormous negative effect on the
      world's health, even though they had good intentions. So this is
      not like a conspiracy where it's, it's really on known like twin
      towers or anything like that where it's really unknown what
      happens. All of this is on the record, so we put links to it. It's all
      historical. Just reality. Yeah.
      Belinda Fettke: 25:54 And where it's going now is the concern
      Dr. Gary Fettke: 25:58 those two arms have come together. And uh, so when you hear
      the term exercise is medicine, which is a brand owned by Coca
      Cola and has come down that whole pathway. So whenever you
      hear the term exercise medicine, that's a victim into food
      industries,
      Belinda Fettke: 26:19 epistatic, Coca Cola, vice president in 1978, the international life
      science institute. So they have got over 400 companies that are
      food and pharmaceutical industries plus whatever else,
      Kellogg's and Coca Cola nicely planted in there. And so this
      exercise is medicine is being led by, it's driven by Coca Cola with
      the entire LLC in the, in the background. So you can imagine
      coca cola is coming this way.
      Dr. Gary Fettke: 26:48 And on the other side of it, the new term is called lifestyle
      medicine. So whenever you hear the term lifestyle medicine,
      that's pretty well been set up started by the Adventist church.
      Virtually everyone at the senior level over the last several years
      is actually flowing from the advantage church
      Belinda Fettke: 27:05 senior level in America, in Asia, in Australia, and the global
      movement in, in the, um, Europe. I don't believe it's as heavily
      influenced. So they're just seeing the movement as an amazing
      thing and joining in. But it's promoting because
      Dr. Gary Fettke: 27:22 lifestyle medicine, it's about eating well, sleeping will,
      moving/exercise and community and bringing that together. But
      it is actually when you listen carefully, dissect their message. It's
      about veganism and it is, in fact when you go back to Australia it
      was, it's actually owned,
      Belinda Fettke: 27:43 The Institute Of lifestyle Medicine is owned by Sanitarium.
      Sanitarium. Yes. Another circle we come back yet again. So they
      put these things into this processed food industry....
      Dr. Gary Fettke: 27:57 So we've got exercise medicine and lifestyle medicine coming
      together and actually developing the medical curriculum for the
      world. And as a result of that, we're seeing, it's already been
      introduced in few universities in the United States and Loma
      Linda...
      Belinda Fettke: 28:15 ...Harvard University and South Carolina Greenville, which
      Stephen Blair's involved with, and he's been funded by Coca
      Cola in the past with the global energy balance network group
      that's now defunct. So
      Ivor: 28:32 these are "Seed universities" ideally expanding to to infiltrate, if
      you will, all of medical education.
      Dr. Gary Fettke: 28:40 And we've got lots of examples of where they're spreading out
      into the South Pacific, into China, into my own Tasmanian, the
      university, very core curriculum, which was part of what it was. I
      didn't realize I, I tried on a landmine in 2014 when that was
      actually being introduced as a test, the test run on the medical
      students. And I came through and said, actually, that's all
      nonsense. This is actually, you know, inflammation is caused by
      sugar, carbs, and poly unsaturated oils,
      Belinda Fettke: 29:14 ...and to shut him down even more then they brought "exercise
      is medicine" as the trademark into our university. And they're
      promoting that. Obviously everything is, you know, "diabetes is
      cured by exercise as medicine". And I'm just going, oh my gosh.
      So, so finding out all this has been incredible.
      Dr. Gary Fettke: 29:30 It is absolutely incredible. And the thing is the union of
      corporate power and state power is actually the definition of
      fascism. I found that out recently, I never viewed it that way,
      but that's the definition of fascism. Here interestingly, I'm not
      saying it's fascism, but we have the allying of corporate power
      and ideological kind of religious interests together, which
      becomes extremely powerful because the huge revenues
      coming in can be redirected towards changing the message,
      changing the whole, the whole perception of everyone. So I'm
      guessing now that people should really be aware of this and
      begin to counter it and counter the fake-food culture that's
      being generated.
      Dr. Gary Fettke: 30:16 I think we know that there's a health issue on the planet
      obesity, diabetes out of control. And we have an answer which
      is healthy eating, eat fresh, local, seasonal food, which actually
      turns out by definition to be low-carb, healthy fat. So we have
      an answer. We have an antidote. So why isn't it being
      promoted? Why isn't it becoming first line management? Well
      now we know, we've always suspected it's food industry have
      been involved but actually now know the mechanism of how
      that's evolved and that the food guidelines is one, but the
      industry is another, and they both have actually supported each
      other. Not For 10 or 20 or 30 or 40 years. But for a hundred
      years and then they build on this history that goes back for
      previous 50 60 80 years to the early 1800's, and I call that
      generational education. You believe what your teachers have
      taught to you and your teachers before then. So as a result, this
      is just become the norm.
      Belinda Fettke: 31:18 And I can just tell you never upset a woman and pick on her
      husband. He goes smoothly because look what's happening. All
      of those things become revealed. Yeah. If they'd never gone off
      to Gary and just if the medical board have just gone, this is a bit
      silly it let's have a conversation. You know, we want you to get
      off social media, whatever else. I've never have looked, but they
      was so dogmatic and I just went, you know what? They're not
      taking my husband down and I'm going to find out why.
      Excellent
      Dr. Gary Fettke: 31:48 Belinda. And you know, but that's often the way of dogmatists,
      especially ideologically driven ones. And they will tend to react
      very strongly when they're in any way threatened with Lego.
      Say lucky they did. And with norcs as well. Looky. They did that
      absurd accusation and now it has blown back on them and the,
      Belinda Fettke: 32:07 that's what Russ Green found out. He found this exercise as
      medicine. Like that's influenced Tim Noakes international life
      science institute is that powerful one that seems to have
      affected Tim Noakes but now we've brought in the fact that it's
      not just that it's this as well and Tim was just like, oh my gosh,
      now I understand why the Vegan movement was so anti what
      I'm talking about. And yeah, I think it's so we have layers here of
      marriages made in hell. It's actually over hundreds of years
      creating a dysfunctional family. I did disease, but
      Ivor: 32:40 there is one thing though the ILS, I might just call out. I had a
      run in with people involved with the ILS cy and I wasn't aware of
      them. I was involved in a debate and they found it afterwards
      about the Ilsi from Belinda. Belinda, actually the message that
      the time you tipped me off and I was amazed when I looked up
      Ilsi, it was a think tank, which has always suspect started in
      America, right around Washington or something, 78 you see a
      think tank starting, you know that's cooperatives revenue kind
      of stuff going on. It's just the way it is. But when you look at all
      their directors and the industry side cover every cocacola and
      Nestle Danone, I mean it's just a who's who, Kellogg's old cereal
      guys and then you look at the other site directors from like
      education and medicine and all these professors, every country
      allied and I just looked and I said, whoa, that's exactly what I do.
      If I had an interest to make what you are describing happen, of
      course you would. Key opinion leaders, bring them in, get them
      on board and talk about research and advancing health and it's
      always eat, eat less. If you have a look at all of their programs
      and carbohydrates and the gospel truth or eat less, move more.
      It's the classic CECO calories in, calories out deception that Coca
      Cola and all the food companies love.
      Dr. Gary Fettke: 34:10 They do listen to them now it's exercise more, eat less.
      Ivor: 34:16 That's what we've worked out. You know, it all z and the
      religion. This is what it thereafter eat. Sorry, move more and eat
      less meat. Now just to be clear that that is the certainly the
      intent. That's not technically a phrase yet. No, no.
      Dr. Gary Fettke: 34:34 Do you look for it? So I mean they're talking about meat tax Uzi
      now it was a um, uh, uh, taking dietetic education into China.
      They're writing the textbooks for Dietitians or dietetics for China
      at the moment and medicine. So there's things to listen out for
      it. Now that you know
      Ivor: 34:55 specifically say it, less meet -they call it "plant based". But you
      know, euphemisms are everywhere.
      Dr. Gary Fettke: 35:01 When you hear the terms "plant based Diet." When you hear
      the term "Vegan", when you hear the term "exercise as
      medicine", when you hear the term "lifestyle medicine" OR
      "ILSI" - just recognize that they have a history behind them,
      which is actually based on ideology, ideology, which is now
      intertwined with corporate vested interest. And it's not their for
      our health, it might, it's advertised as such. And they believe in
      it. We don't always agree it's a bit of marriage counseling - Ivor
      intervene quick! But they believe it's for health. So in fairness
      they, but health and salvation and that's the difference
      Ivor: 35:43 mixture. That's always the problem. And, and in fairness, the
      disclaimer is very important, not against religion, not against
      these diets. However, the problem, the problem's who religion
      historically for thousands of years, uh, often they've been great
      ideas with good intentions, but certain dogmas then are what
      have caused the issue over over centuries and millennia. And
      here we're seeing, you know, a lot of what they're doing is for
      the right reason. It's good stuff on. Unfortunately it's just
      carrying with as a Trojan horse of something that's completely
      irrational and anti scientific and that's being carried through.
      Dr. Gary Fettke: 36:21 I think that's perfect. That's it. I just got up off to the wrong
      start. So you know, occasionally you might drive up the highway
      on the wrong side and sooner or later you'll work out that, hang
      on, we've gotten, we're in trouble
      Ivor: 36:36 or less. You get the whole world to switch the sides, which you
      drive od, which it looks like what they're trying to do
      Dr. Gary Fettke: 36:43 because I realized we're in trouble, but I actually think, you
      know, there's this head on collision that's about to happen and
      uh, if you, if we understand history, I mean I, I looked at her
      aghast. I went, what? There's barriers either as a and then
      before know, I know, but when you first read baby Gary first
      haired, the stuff he's saying, hold on a minute. Are you sure he
      come home from work and I go, you ain't funny, fun a fanned
      out today. I spoke out about this at the crossfit games last year.
      They killed conference in and I said to Belinda, I need to now
      recheck all this before I'm going to say it out loud. He'd been
      listening to me just believing me. And, and so I've got all the
      references. So all that talk was completely referenced. But
      before that we actually popped in and saw, I rang up Zoe
      [inaudible].
      Dr. Gary Fettke: 37:29 This is Zoe. I'm going to drag her in. I said, Zoe, can we come
      and have a chat to you? So we traveled from Australia to Wiles,
      uh, Zoe and Andy and Maraica sobers came up from Cape Town
      and we sat there in their house for five days and said, are we
      crazy? Can we just check it all with you? And so we had five
      laptops going all cross referencing and they actually agree,
      yeah, you're actually right. We're not making it up. And then the
      talk was given, it's been acknowledged repeatedly since then by
      members of the Adventist church. We've got a lot of exit
      vendors to have come along and said, you're absolutely right.
      They'd probably be my biggest supporters now. Like some of
      the people who had contacted me the most and talk to me and
      this, it just makes sense. I hadn't realized. And, and then, and
      then in most recent times, this acknowledgement by the
      Adventist church that what we're talking about is actually
      completely relevant. So as we all move forward, it's just
      important to know if someone comes to your table that what
      hat they're wearing. Yeah. And I think in going forward, ideology
      also needs to be discussed as a conflict of interest
      Belinda Fettke: 38:36 in nutrition science because it's, it's having a huge influence.
      Ivor: 38:40 I actually love that point, Belinda to so many important points
      here. It's dizzying. But that one is huge in itself because an
      ideological driver for, for a human being is much more powerful
      than simply some extra money. True classic conflict of interest.
      The coi is we see influencing Madison and there are studies on
      this can sometimes on the amount to a few thousand dollars a
      year and gifts to doctors I'm sure, but ideology is a much more
      powerful driver of a human than any more than it comes from
      the heart. And it's part of your, your essential intent. We used
      to call it in management. Uh, but that's a huge point. Conflict of
      interest should include if you have religious and ideological
      beliefs that, that that clearly would affect your, your, your bias
      towards certain,
      Belinda Fettke: 39:29 this is where it is, you know, there's a huge conflict of interest
      and it just needs to be acknowledged. And, uh, and I, in going
      forward, if we are creating, I mean, do we need guidelines at all
      but for sick people, if we're going forward and creating
      guidelines, it needs, you know, we may need those people
      who've got incredible experience in a Vegan Diet to be helping
      write that part of the dietary guidelines, but acknowledging
      them their beliefs and then people who want to talk about low
      carb, we need to get those people in, not the people who have
      got the Vegan interests doing the low carb. You know, it's, it's
      about creating fairness I think.
      Ivor: 40:06 And transparency, transparency, transparency above all where
      everyone is as laid out in the table where they're coming from.
      Yeah. Very good. Well, I think that's going to begin the
      happening in the coming years. The race I've switch all of this
      gets resolved is the debate. I think, I know talking to a Dr
      Seinfeld about this a few times over the years, will it take
      around 10 years to largely get more clarity, transparency and
      good science or will it be faster with the growing low carb on
      movement is quite rapid growth. We might close will now, what
      do you think to reach a point where largely things are more
      transparent and the general public have more of a grasp on
      Dr. Gary Fettke: 40:49 hi, I'd like to think it's going to happen tomorrow, but it's going
      to take a lot longer. I think there are so many forces out there
      that we can't change the world we'd like to, but we can as
      individuals make a decision about what we do this afternoon
      and tomorrow we can do that for our families and that all of the
      work we're doing is to support those people in want to make a
      difference. And so yes, it, you know, it'd be nice to save the
      world, but we're going to need to start with saving ourselves
      first of all. Um, and a lot of the resources for this and the two
      are billionaires put together just to let you know, and it's on the,
      I support gary.com site so that we're making it all public. It's all,
      I created a website
      Belinda Fettke: 41:34 really annoyed Afra no doubt. I created a website saying I
      support gay. And I've just started putting all these things up and
      it's been really interesting. Like journalists have contacted me,
      the u s right to know has recently contacted me. They wanted
      to know about the cereal, um, documents that I've uncovered.
      So it's quite fascinating creating a website that just supports
      your husband is something they never expect.
      Ivor: 41:56 It was Super Rubia and that's the beauty of the modern, you
      know, Internet environment where, where people can fight
      back with inflammation against misinformation. So, so that's a
      fantastic platform. And I guess when we release this, I put the
      links also. And I also think if we did, we mentioned this before, a
      a nice kind of a family tree going back to the 1800 stills with the
      key players and interconnections. Maybe that's, that's
      something to be good to work with you on that. Excellent. We'll
      do that for transparency. Oh, that's crazy. Not for going after
      anyone for transparency and honesty. Did it. Great. Thanks.
      Hey, fantastic job. Great job you guys. Thanks. Bye.
