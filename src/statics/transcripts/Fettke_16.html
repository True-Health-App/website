welcome to the fat Emperor podcast I'm your host Ivor Cummins we're supported by the Irish heart disease awareness charity which advocates a simple CT scan to reveal your CAC score so know your score and take action to prevent that premature heart attack everything you need to know will be right here we're here at low carb universe and Miaka and as you can see the beautiful backdrop behind us but we're still working hard don't worry about that and I'm meeting with this morning with dr. Gary FATCA and Belinda FATCA who have a very interesting story to tell so delays to meet again Gary IVA Linda hi thank you for having us oh my pleasure absolutely and you have a fascinating story well kind of two stories first your persecution and exoneration and then we get on to the fascinating kind of background of where all the dietary guidelines came from and why ultimately you got into trouble so maybe yeah maybe Gary if you start with that what a lot of people already know my story is very similar to Tim Noakes going back several years I started challenging hospital food and particularly the amount of sugar that was given to my patients no I look from an orthopedic surgeon in Tasmania for many years I've been looking after the complications of diabetes and particularly foot ulceration so I've been shopping toes off chopping legs off for a couple of decades and ultimately he gets sick and tired of it so I looked at prevention and quite clearly sugar became the number one problem so I started questioning the amount of sugar my patients were getting in hospital and to this day if you've got diabetes in hospital it's still recommended that you get three desserts per day I mean it's how I said look this is crazy this is ridiculous and I started questioning that in the process of questioning the sugar in the hospital in hospital food and junk food in hospital I started questioning the quality of hospital food and we all know hospital food is lousy and can be improved so that incurred the wrath of the dieticians in the hospital and over a period of time ultimately I ended up getting reported to the Medical Board for being dangerous for recommending an T sugar and low carb and the medical and then I subsequently got reported again by another dietician for inappropriately claiming to Reverb reversed someone's diabetes which I'm guilty of okay we did reverse his diabetes only came off five medications lost 20 kilos and all of that so and then there was a third notification to the Medical Board which ultimately got dismissed but the first two were taken very seriously and over a couple of years two and a half years I was investigated and a decision was made against me to say that I'm not allowed to advise my patients as an orthopedic surgeon to reduce their sugar intake even even if it was shown to be best practice and that was a decision that was made lifelong and not appealable so obviously you know once you see the results of low carb for your patients you can't unsee them and so I've never stopped talking about it in the end and with the support of Belinda with her research and with the support of social media and the community we've kept on challenging that and its involved to Senate inquiries at a national level that's involved the national Ombudsman and after two more years of appealing my non appealable decision we couldn't go to the Supreme Court we couldn't use the judicial system to appeal it but we could go to the National Health Ombudsman to see if there was a problem with the process that was all she could rule on ER she couldn't rule she couldn't say that Gary could be so we showed that there were problems in the process which clearly there were Belinda will allude to those and ultimately it was sent to an independent Medical Board and they looked at it for six weeks and they tossed it all out and said this is ridiculous say that I wasn't guilty of anything they've actually apologized now that's a it's a almost unheard of that you actually get an apology from the Medical Board but you know ultimately we lost five years of being dragged through the system and in that time frame my lecturing the students was taken away my research was curtailed and we've been stuck in that limbo but in the same time frame we've also been you know going forward and to the public well it's an incredible job to have gone through all that both of you actually obviously it's to shared the experience so to speak it was also particularly malicious because I noted at the time which was incredible they said that even if the science advanced and you were proven to be correct you would still remain banned for life from speaking that's a bizarre it was completely bizarre and obviously I questioned that and that's one of the things which the National Ombudsman was actually to hang on because she said even she said hang on this this is a how can you make coconut because so many things you know I say that science evolves by being challenged not by being followed and you know that's on the bottom of my emails I mean that's my manta ray so we have to keep evolving in our knowledge and there are things we do today which are going to be shown to be wrong in the future yeah as they have in the past and so it was it was a dumb ruling and you know and thank goodness for comment I think you know it sounds spiteful and it was their undoing really yeah and it's like it was amazing to me and I've seen a lot of corruption in this whole sphere obviously like ourselves but but that one struck me as bizarre and the thought crossed my mind as well that's kind of implicating them in a sense so it did turn out to be and how we got here then is the other parent of the story so you're exonerated and it's a huge shot in the arm for people all over the world trying to promote healthier food like Noakes exoneration yours an adult quest in Sweden it's literally mine was the last case to be closed and so therefore I know that it's pretty well opened the floodgates I mean I've been contacted by hundreds of doctors who have said actually we feel safe now to go and go ahead with this and all about it and so therefore it has opened the door and it now can become best practice in diabetes management it can become he says it can become but you look on our dietary guidelines and you look at the dieticians Association of Australia which is our peak nutrition body and they're still calling low carb a fad so while the medical border said yes I think you can go forward with this I can't see a problem the guidelines still rule books that I'm not going to allow it to yeah it followed so and that is a great segue into how did we get here with such absurd guidelines that quite frankly conflict with the science at this point there's no question well let's let's take it a snapshot of time now which is if we look at we've got an obesity epidemic we've gotten it a health crisis on the planet right now you can see that walking down the street and so we've had in place dietary guidelines for a long period of time and one of the arguments is that we don't follow the dietary guidelines well we know we do if you look at the last 4050 years of data out of the u.s. out of Australia out of the UK we have in fact increased our cereal and grains we've decreased our meat and particularly our red meat consumption we've done that so the current dietary guidelines are serial based grain based aunty meat anti dairy and rapidly becoming vegan so let's that's the food pyramid that's really what's being promoted I love it and guess what it hasn't worked so therefore we've looked to say that an obviously low carb healthy fat living is not the food pyramid so if we accept the fact that the dietary guidelines now have been a complete and utter failure and have since the McGovern report and the introduction of the diet American dietary goals then we've gone back to see how come we've gotten to this situation because Belinda said we talk we know we're all going blue in the face talking about this and blenders gone we'll hang on guys why why are we being obstructed why have I been obstructed it's got to be in those dietary guidelines but more importantly what's influencing them and that that's that's the segue in whatever we're doing at the moment isn't working I'm challenging that what am i challenging the guidelines or am i challenging the vested interests and as it turned out it's the vested interests that have been blocking myself and others in this whole process and I think that I guessed that it could well be the sugar industry in Australia we have a very large sugar and wheat industry so we sort of thought okay they're really unhappy about that so I thought it was vested interests and but when I started looking deeper it was really fascinating everyone sort of gotten stuck in this 1977 and they changed to the low-fat guidelines but I just kept going back and it was fascinating all the way back to what I what I've come to understand is it's the evolution of the so the evolution of our plant based diet regard lines have come from the two arms of the temperance movement which sounds really bizarre going all the way to the 1800s and in professing this conversation I think it's really important to say that I'm not anti religion in any way going down and finding some very strong religious influences on our dietary guidelines was just something I never expected to find so I'm not anti religion and I'm not anti vegetarian or vegan even I think people have the right to a choice and whether that's cultural ethical or a religious ideology you know they have that ability to have that choice in our current society I would think and certainly from me but as I've gone through and looked at their influence the influence of vested interest and religious ideology on our dietary guidelines and particularly the evolution of the plant-based which is I believe a vegan diet regard lines they've taken away my choice and they've taken away your choice and they've taken away society's choice to eat meat and it's bizarre you think I thought Gary was in trouble for talking about sugar and cereal but it was actually he was in trouble for advocating animal protein and animal fats right and this story and I am broadly familiar with us well the viewers may not be it goes back literally to the eighteen hundreds if you do proper detective work which no one really has it's simple endure except Linda oh yeah I'm a race southern there's a young guy in in America with southern has done a lot of research into specifically the seventh-day Adventist Church dieticians on the Dietary Guidelines so from about the 1950s a lot of my research I got from him so I'm not the only person but he hadn't realized the medical influences he was specifically looking dietitians but he gave me an amazing segue into into going back but I then went back even further because I found that the introduction of the well the formation of the American Dietetic Association was founded by a seventh-day adventists so you're going even further back but he'd certainly found a lot of information from the 1950s all right great so if we go to the the origins of the origin the Ark in the eighteen hundreds yeah yeah where it really began this influencing force that that I guess grew over the century and became more and more organized and more more modern and and subtle in its actions it started in the late eighteen hundreds with certain lady I think and it actually started right at the beginning of the 1800s with a guy called Sylvester Graham and you're may have heard of graham crackers and gram flour and others they were all to stop people being stimulated by caffeine and alcohol and cigarettes and meat and they believed there was a scientific and political and religious rationale for vegetarianism so he was the health reformers of the early 1800s with a start of this rationale Western vegetarianism western vegetarianism is completely different eastern best vegetarianism that's Gary will explain that well it's vegetarian is based upon a cultural respect for it where the animal sits within the whole food cycle and even in eastern vegetarianism they will eat some animal produce and then when the animal gets old they'll you know for a lot of religions they'll actually eat the animal but that's done in a respectful way and so Eastern vegetarian is built on centuries of care the soil the environment like it and the whole picture whereas Western vegetarianism really only goes back to the early 1800s and is purely most people too to quell their last their lust and that it seems strange but that's what it is and then that's evolved until one group which was found in founders of the Adventists church and then they brought those principles of so it wasn't just stimulants of again caffeine and alcohol and cigarettes but they believe one of the biggest stimulants in our life was meat and it actually became Church doctrine to not eat meat to stir Vaser passions and the most heinous sin of all was masturbation so this is where cereals came from the Sirians she was birthed from this belief that we have that to try and find ways people have protein and different things in their body to to get rid of meat right because meat who've seen and I think the the origins of the words I mean Karen a meat carnal there's a lot of negative connotations in history and I guess they really jumped on that and thought has a really big negative influence on there's a society like alcohol or are things that means they could make was masturbation no whole her entire book her first book was all it was a solemn appeal to mothers and how to stop your child masturbating well the biggest thing was not to put meat on their table and in I segwayed it's sort of differently in my talk so I really came back and and talked about the term its movement and and worked out ways because John Harvey Kellogg is obviously someone we recognize as a person involved with the cereal industry and he and his brother who developed to flaked cereal but it was so then I said well you know why why was he so intent on devoting peanut butters and that made analogs and all of these other things he was a temperance Health reformer and he was a devout seventh-day Adventists so you bring those things down and you think well that we've got Kellogg's cornflakes from an anti masturbation crusade but poor old John Harvey Kellogg yeah he was a brilliant individually in a sheave greatness in the medical pathway medical education medical reform but 30 patients on food and exercise equipment but there's a 12 year old he was invited into the white family and he was typesetting the these doctrines he was typesetting as a twelve-year-old these causes masturbation and and the the effect of masturbation was as bad as inwardly decaying her head and also her her book was horrific if you read all the things that masturbation could do to you and he was twelve years old when he was typesetting these books well and so it was it for the next you know he types it for four years for them and wrote or he was actually editing and doing things so there's no wonder by the time he grew up to become a doctor he had very strong ideas on how bad masturbation was following on from that we should state that the where things are now is that the latest church is the second biggest educator in the world after the Catholic Church and our primary school secondary schools universities but they pretty well started the Dietetics education of the world they wrote the textbooks for the first thirty years and heavily involved in the textbooks of nursing and medicine they still own sixty publishing houses and that pretty well and as I've said to you recently that have had six point four billion downloads of their podcasts in 2016 now I I was struck by that figure because I mean that it puts Joe Rogan's to shame but it six point four billion downloads just gives an idea of of the influence that's occurring and I think the financials of this this whole organization that influencing in so many ways their financials are quite stunning to across the world are late well again they own pretty well so involved in the food industry horizontally and vertically acknowledging that only about eight weeks ago [Music] the senior members of the event start achill in general called religion acknowledging virtually everything we're talking about now so this is not they're not hiding it then actually not upset by they're actually proud of what they've been able to achieve and so they are they are the originators of nutrition science they have been heavily involved in their nutritional guidelines since the beginning because the American Dietetics Association was formed in October 1917 by Leonard Cooper who wrote these textbooks she worked with John Hart for John Harvey Kellogg she was an Adventist and a vegetarian and a vegetarian at that time actually turns out you were vegan the term vegan didn't turn up - was it coined - 1944 so the Adventist Church doctrine was based on the Garden of Eden they're young earth creationists and so the Garden of Eden was fruits nuts vegetables and seeds and they so that was all so there's no history in HoN together there's no place in their history of there's no evolution but there's no place in history for meat so they truly believe this is what we should be eating and hey guys just a quick break to remind you to this podcast is only possible due to funding from the Irish heart disease awareness charity and its founder David barber David discovered he had massive heart disease in 2012 and could only do so by getting a five-minute calcification scan and CAC score it enabled him to take action to stop the disease process and to save his own life now he is spending millions to help others do likewise all we ask is to help get the message out on the power of CAC watch the Widowmaker movie linked at the end of this podcast and share it as widely as you can thank you and now we return to the conversation so the eating of meat is almost it's an aberration it's humans going a bit crazy and driving further craziness and self-abuse yeah it's a man and I think just in terms of veg I didn't know any of this story obviously before you do get all up and the other guy whoever but I was aware that in the McGovern Commission there was a very influential young person who was vegetarian I was aware of that fact and I suspected that because vegetarian are particularly vegan people are extremely motivated ideologically whereas the average person is not I was always guessing they were disproportionately represented in guidelines bodies and anywhere where they could influence which is okay I do that if I was ideologically motivated but I think it's just so much more huge than we thought they've been working their way up through the system for a hundred years and can I say when they a lot of their ideas are amazing like it really is it's about rest and exercise and a whole lot surviving sleep a community and a community and the anti alcohol cigarettes and stimulants but what's really fascinating is how they've moved together so I say that the two forms of the temperance movement one was the health reformer ones which is the anti meat group but they've joined with the other temperance movement which is anti alcohol and has warned the sugar industry so not it doesn't start sugar but it formed these industries of coca-cola and ice cream sundaes and chocolate and all those other things so this sweet and also then putting the sweet into the cereals it allowed them to find a way to celebrate his families and be communities and whatever else I'm not having alcohol so these soda fountains were called the new American Bar yeah it was an ally of temperance so the food industry that was creating the sugar and the fur and the food industry from the seventh-day adventists that were all aligned with a vegetarian substitutes of meat just match so beautifully together because the sugar gives shelf-life to the vegetarian products it doesn't help meat so you know this is where it's all interconnected and Harvard University was the start of the nutrition foundation and the School of Public Health were all started by food industry so five fruit industries gave money to this Nutrition Foundation which was part of the Harvard School of Public Health and they worked with the Adventist Church to do the very first event of studies because it suits both yeah they grow together and even though they've got very opposing ideas about things the interconnection and and has just helped and this has happened in all of human history to be honest it it seems bizarre what you described but to me to me it's actually makes it makes complete sense because in human history we've always had different sects and organizations who have common goals you know who get together even though they might differ significantly on one or two things so it kind of all just came together throughout the 20th century that they grew and grew and power and influence until they were kind of embedded in all of the structures yeah and so financially to come back to that the the the cereal industry 101 cereal companies were formed in Battle Creek Michigan which is the home of the Adventists Church and over time we've effectively got Kellogg's and all of their affiliates but because they're largely owned by originally by the Adventists and they have Adventists work for them they're tired so you could imagine 10% of the profits of the cereal industry is going back into the church in Australia ellen terry white came to australia and started a company called sanitarium which is australia's most trusted company she set up the entire church but she also wanted to set up the cereal industry as a church owned so that was different Kellogg's was a cemetery vendor Stanley started his own business but they actually came to Australia and set the food industry with one of the Koch brothers and that church owns the biggest cereal company in Australia and they don't pay any tax but they put it all back into educating the community so that's where the enormous resources come from to create the billions of podcasts and everything else because the profits are not being taken by corporate executive types and shareholders they came back to the church but they have this purpose they believe clearly in what they're doing oh and so it's all it's all ploughed straight back into medical evangelism with where charity starters so in no tax the wall tiles there's no tax on sanitaire and they make 462 different products and they don't pay any check but sanitarium being the biggest serial company in Australia I mean that I guess I'm just coming back did they're very large amounts of revenue indeed this Wow but then they brought the Adventist Church by by Harry Miller brought soy from Asia the method saw to the concept of soy to the Western world so that modern soy product which is saw that as an alternative to have made substitute so we've got fake meat fake dairy we've got infant formulas which are made predominantly from soy Kerry Miller and so if you think about the the massive impact of soy in the food cycle and going all the way back to affecting our agricultural practice now you know they're plowing of soil to put in more soybean that is actually all from the one group so that whole soy industry is paying tithe back into the one church group and that's where their funding is and that all of this stuff is actually in their annual report somewhere it's not it's not hidden but as significant portions of it and so you can actually read their annual reports think it's got all the figures and it talks about the industries they actually own but and I think that study is a very important point because along with the disclaimer and I'll also echo that one that vegetarian is fine of many vegetarian friends in fact in our Irish Medical Group were setting up we have a vegan psychiatrist a doctor in our group so it's fine but not to try and influence the whole world in the way we're discussing but the other it's taking away a choice that's that's the thing they're taking away a choice by developing these rule books that silence my husband that exactly and that obviously have I used the word corrupted but it is corrupted soy refined grains and infinite formulas and all the fake food that's having an enormous negative effect on world's health even though they had good intentions so this is not like a conspiracy where it's it's really unknown like Twin Towers or anything like that where it's really unknown what happens all of this is on the record so we put links to it it's all historical just reality yes where it's going now is the concern so those two arms have come together and so when you hear the term exercises medicine which is a brand owned by coca-cola and it's come down that whole pathway so whenever you hear for the term exercise medicine that's effectively the food industry's started by coca-cola vice-president in 1978 the International Life Science Institute so they have got over 400 companies that are food and pharmaceutical industries plus whatever else Kellogg's and coca-cola that nicely planted in there and so this exercises medicine is being led by that's driven by coca-cola with the entire LZ in the in the background so you can imagine Coca Cola's coming this way and on the other side of it the new term is called lifestyle medicine so whenever you hear the term lifestyle medicine that's pretty well been set up started by the Adventist Church virtually everyone at the senior level over the last several years has actually found from the Adventist Church senior level in America in Asia in Australia and the global movement in in the Europe I don't believe it's as heavily influenced so they're just seeing the movement as an amazing thing and joining in but it's promoting because it but it sounds great lifestyle medicine is about eating well sleeping will moving exercising and and community and bringing that together but it is actually when you listen and carefully dissect their message it's about veganism and it is in fact when you go back Australia that was it's actually owned oh shoot of lifestyle medicine is owned by sanitarium sanitarium yes another circle we come back yes so they put these things into this processed food industry has yeah but we're at now is we've got exercises medicine and lifestyle medicine that coming together and actually developing the medical curriculum for our face of the world and as a result of that we're seeing it's already been introduced in few universities in the United States Loma Linda which Adventist University Harvard University and South Carolina Greenville which Stephen Blair's involved with and he's been funded by coca-cola in the past with the global energy balance Network group that's now defunct so these are seed universities ideally expanding to to infiltrate if you will all of medical education yes and they already are and we've got lots of examples of where they're spreading out into the South Pacific into China into my own Tasmanian University medical curriculum which was part of what I was I didn't realize I'd tried on a land mine in 2014 when that was actually being introduced as a test the test run on the medical students and I came through and said actually that's all nonsense this is actually you know inflammation is caused by sugar carbs and polyunsaturated oils and to shut him down even more then they brought exercise is medicine as the trademark into our University and they're promoting that obviously so everything is you know diabetes is cured by exercise as medicine and I'm just going oh my gosh so so finding out all this has been incredible it is absolutely incredible and the the thing is the union of corporate power and state power is actually the definition of fascism just I found that out recently I'd never viewed it that way but that's the definition of fascism I had here interests me I'm not saying it's fascism but we have the a lying of corporate power and ideological kind of religious interests together which becomes extremely powerful because the huge revenues coming in can be redirected towards changing the message changing the holes the whole perception of everyone so I'm guessing now that people should really be aware of this and begin to counter us and counter the fake food culture that's being generated we know that there's a health issue on the planet you know basically diabetes aren't role and we have an answer which is healthy eating eat fresh local seasonal food which actually turns out by definition to be low carb health effect so we have an answer we have an antidote so why isn't it being promoted why isn't it becoming first-line management well now we know we've always suspected it some food industry of being involved but actually we now know the mechanism of how that's evolved and that the Kombi you know the food guidelines are one but the industry is another and then both of actually supported each other not for 10 or 20 or 30 or 40 years but for a hundred years and then build on this history that goes back for previous 50 60 80 years to the early 1800s so our whole and I call that generational education you believe what your teachers have taught you and your teachers before them so as a result this has just become the norm and I can just tell you never upset a woman and pick on her husband absolutely because look what's happened all of this has become revealed yeah if they'd never gone after Garry and just if the Medical Board have just gone this is bit silly let's have a conversation you know we want you to get off social media or whatever else I never have looked but they were so dogmatic and I just went you know what they're not taking my husband down and I'm gonna find out why excellent Belinda and you know but that's often the way of dogmatists especially ideologically driven ones that they will tend to react very strongly when they're in any way threatened but like you say looki they did and with Noakes as well lookey they did that absurd you know accusation and now it has blown back on them and you know Russ green found out he found this exercise as medicine like that's influenced Tim Noakes International Life Science Institute is that powerful one that seems to have affected Tim Noakes but now we've brought in the fact that it's not just that it's this as well and Tim was just like oh my gosh now I understand why the vegan movement was so aunty what I'm talking about and yeah I think so we have layers here of marriages made in hell essentially over hundreds of years creating a dysfunctional family had a disease epidemic but there is one thing though the ILS I might just call out I had a run-in with people involved with the ILS I and I wasn't aware of them I I was involved in a debate and I found out afterwards about the ILS I but from Belinda I believe be messaged at the time you tip me off and I was amazed when I looked up ILS I it was a think-tank which is all the suspect started in America right around Washington or something 78 you see a pink tank starting you know that's corporate revenue kind of stuff going on it's the way it is but when you look and all their directors in the industry side cover every coca-cola Nestle Danone I mean it's just a who's who Kellogg's all the cereal guys and then you look at the other side directors from like education and medicine and all these professors every country allied and I just looked and I said whoa that's exactly what I do if I had an interest to make what you're describing happen of course you what key opinion leaders bring them in get them on board and talk about research and advancing health and X and it's always eat more eat less if you have a look at all of their programs like and carbohydrates and the gospel truth you Oh eat less move more it's the classic seco calories in calories out deception that coca-cola and all the food companies love but if you listen to them now it's exercise more ate less that's what we've worked out you know ills II and the religion this is what it there after eight but so I move more and eat less meat now just to be clear that that is the certainly the intent that's not technically a phrase yet no no but if you hear it for that you look for it so I mean they talk about meat tax ills II now it was a taking Dietetic education into China they're writing the textbooks for dietitians or Dietetics for China at the moment and medicine so that the things to listen out for now that you know they might not specifically say it let's meet let's call it plant-based but you know euphemisms are everywhere ER and when you hear the terms plant-based diet when you hear the term vegan when you hear the term exercise is medicine when you hear the term lifestyle medicine ills II just recognize that they have a history behind them which is actually based on ideology ideology which is now intertwined with corporate vested interests and it's not there for our health it might it's advertised as such and they believe in it we don't always agree ok there's a bit of marriage counseling over intervened quick but they believe it's for health so in fairness they but health and salvation and that's the difference it's the heady mixture that's always the problem and and in fairness the disclaimer is very important not against religion not against these diets however the problem the problems with religion historically for thousands of years often have been great ideas with good intentions but certain dogmas then are what have caused the issue over over centuries and millennia and here we're seeing you know a lot of what they're doing is for the right reason it's good stuff and unfortunately it's just carrying with as a Trojan horse of something that's completely irrational and anti-scientific and that's being carried through unfortunately I think that's perfect that's it they got it I just got up off to the wrong start so you know occasionally you might drive up the highway that on the wrong side and sooner or later you'll work out that hang on we've gotten we're in trouble or less you get the whole world to switch the sides if you drive up which it looks like what they're trying to do because I realized we're in trouble but I actually think you know there's this head-on collision yet out to happen and if you are if we understand history I mean I looked at her aghast I went what does Percy Paris and that's all I know but when you first but baby Gary first heard the stuff is in hold on a minute you sure he'd come in from where can I go you won't believe what I found out today I spoke out about this at the CrossFit Games last year their field conference in and I said Linda I need to now recheck all this before I'm going to say it out loud who'd been listening to me and just believing me and and so I got all the references so all that talk was completely referenced but before that we actually popped in and saw I rang up Zoe harken it's a Zoe I'm gonna drag her in I said Zoe can we come and have a chat to you so we traveled from Australia to Wales Zoe and Andy and Marika sorbus came up from Cape Town and we sat there in their house for five days and said are we crazy can we just check it all with you and so we had five laptops going all cross-referencing a name secret yeah you're actually right yeah we're not making it up and and then that talk was given it's been acknowledged repeatedly since then by members of the inventors church we've got a lot of ex Adventists who have come along and said you're absolutely right they'd probably be my biggest supporters now unlike some of the people who had contacted me the most and talked to me and just go just make sense I hadn't realized and then and then in most recent times this acknowledgement by the Adventist Church that what we're talking about is actually completely relevant so as we all move forward it's just important to know if someone comes to your table that what happed I wearing and I and I think in going forward ideology also needs to be discussed as a conflict of interest in nutrition science because it's it's having a huge influence I actually loved our point Belinda to so many important points it's dizzying but that one is huge in itself because an ideological driver for for human being is much more powerful than simply some extra money true classic conflict of interest the CEO is we see influencing medicine and there are Studies on this can sometimes only amount to a few thousand dollars a year and gifts to doctors and sure but ideology is a much more powerful driver of a human than any it comes on half it comes in the heart and it's part of your your essential intent we used to call it management and but that's a huge point conflict of interest should include if you have religious and ideological beliefs that that that clearly would affect your your your bias toward certain but this is where it is you know there's a huge conflict of interest and it just needs to be acknowledged and and I in going forward if we're creating I mean do any guidelines at all but for sick people if we're going forward and creating guidelines it need you know we may need those people who've got incredible experience in a vegan diet to be helping right that part of the dietary guidelines but acknowledging them their beliefs and then people who want to talk about low-carb we need to get those people are not the people who have got the vegan interests doing the low-carb you know it's it's about creating fairness I think and transparency above all transparency above all where everyone is as laid it out on the table where they're coming from very good well I think that's going to begin happening in the coming years the rate at which all of this gets resolved is is the debate I think I know talking to andreas Seinfeld about this a few times over the years will it take around ten years to largely get more clarity transparency and and good science or will it be faster with the growing low-carb keto movement is quite rapid growth we might close on now what do you think to reach a point where largely things are more transparent and the general public have more of a grasp of the science I'd like to think it's going to happen tomorrow but it's going to take a lot longer I think there are so many forces out there that we can changed the world would like to but we can as individuals make a decision about what we do this afternoon and tomorrow we can do that for our families and that all of the work we're doing is to support those people who want to make a difference and so yes we it you know it would be nice to save the world but we're going to need to start with saving ourselves first of all and a lot of the resources for this and the viterbi lenders put together just to let you know it's on the I support gary comm site so that we're making it all public it's all there I created a website really annoyed ephra no doubt I created a website saying I support Gary and I've just started putting all these things up and it's been really interesting like journalists have contacted me the u.s. right-to-know has recently contacted me they want to know about the serial documents that I've uncovered so it's quite fascinating creating a website that just supports your husband is something they never expected it was super obeah and that's the beauty in the modern you know internet environment where where people can fight back with information against misinformation so so that's a fantastic platform and i guess when i release this i'll put the links also and i also think if we did we mentioned us before a nice kind of family tree going back to the eighteen hundreds just with the key players and interconnections maybe that's that's something to be good excellent we'll do that for transparency well that's not for going after anyone for transparency and it's just honesty put it there great thanks hey thanks a
